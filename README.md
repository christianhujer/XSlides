*XSlides* is an XML based system for presentation slides.
I develop it as my personal replacement for PowerPoint.

I do a lot of presentations that contain source code.
Pasting and syntax highlighting source code is awkward.

I do a lot of larger presentations that consist of smaller modules.
Managing modular presentations is awkward.

I do a lot of presentations that contain information from external resources.
This includes auto-generated vector graphics and similar things.
Connecting PowerPoint to external info sources is awkward.

So I decided to create something that fits my requirements better.

If you are into XML-based presentation systems, also checkout Slidy2 aka HTML Slidy from Dave Ragget.
Slidy2 is based on (X)HTML and JavaScript.
