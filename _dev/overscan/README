This directory contains a prototype for an overscan feature.

Sometimes the setup for a presentation is not perfect.
The projector might display only parts of the screen properly.
There might be some regions at the border of the screen which are not properly visible.

The purpose of the overscan feature is to compensate that.
For this, the overscan feature defines:
- screen, which is the entire region visible in the browser.
- viewport, which is the used region and can be the same or smaller than the screen.
- overscan, which is the unused region at the border of the screen.

This version of the overscan feature has been tested…

…successfully with:
- Firefox 15
- rekonq 0.7.0
- Opera 12.16

…partially successful with:
- Chrome 21 (saving overscan in cookie doesn't work)
- Chromium 18 (saving overscan in cookie doens't work)

…unsuccessful with:
- Konqueror 4.6.5

The tests are good enough to consider overscan in a future version of XSlides.
